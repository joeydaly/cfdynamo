      <h3>CFDynamo</h3>
      <p>CFDynamo is a typically lame-named ColdFusion wrapper for the Amazon DynamoDB Java API.</p> 
      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>To build a simple but effective CFC wrapper for the Java AWS SDK for DynamoDB.</p>
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Setup is faily simple, with the only realy consideration being the implementation for the Java AWS SDK on your Railo/ACF instance.</p>
      <p>I use Tomcat with Railo and have done the following:</p>
      <ol> 
        <li>Download/expand the Zip archive from Github</li>
        <li>Rename the downloaded folder to cfdynamo</li>
        <li>Inside the assets folder is a Zip archive containing the AWS and related JARs ... expand this archive (the expanded archive will be named "aws")</li>
        <li>Move the newly expanded "aws" folder^ into your {tomcat root}/lib folder</li>
        <li>Open {tomcat root}/conf/catalina.properties and find the line with "common.loader="</li>
        <li>Add the following to the end of the common.loader= line: ,${catalina.home}/lib/aws,${catalina.home}/lib/aws/*.jar</li>
        <li>Add the "cfdynamo" folder and its content to your web application or web root (you can remove the examples and other files, not in the com folder, if you like)</li>
        <li>Add a mapping to "cfdynamo" in your web administrator ... the sample app attemtps to create a /cfdynamo mapping for you, but, if you're going to use this in an application, it's probably best to just add the mapping the the administrator</li>
        <li>Retart Tomcat/Railo</li> 
      </ol>
      <p>If you use Adobe ColdFusion 9, the general idea is the same but here is how I configured ACF9 (stand-alone server) to load my AWS JARs:</p> 
        <ol>
          <li>Download/expand the Zip archive from Github</li>
          <li>Rename the downloaded folder to cfdynamo</li>
          <li>Inside the assets folder is a Zip archive containing the AWS and related JARs ... expand this archive (the expanded archive will be named "aws")</li>
          <li>Move the newly expanded "aws" folder^ into your {Adobe ColdFusion 9 Install Folder}/WEB-INF/lib folder</li>
          <li>Open {Adobe ColdFusion 9 Install Folder}/runtime/bin/jvm.config and find the line with "java.class.path=" (there may be a better way to do this but this is how I got it working with the lest amount of headaches)</li>
          <li>Add the following to the end of the java.class.path= line: ,{application.home}/../wwwroot/WEB-INF/lib/aws</li>
          <li>Add the "cfdynamo" folder and its content to your web application (you can remove the examples and other files if you like)</li>
          <li>Add a mapping to "cfdynamo" in your web administrator ... the sample app attemtps to create a /cfdynamo mapping for you, but, if you're going to use this in an application, it's probably best to just add the mapping the the administrator</li>
          <li>Retart ACF 9</li>
        </ol>
      <h3>Sample App</h3>
      <p>Other than the assets folder in this Git repository, which you need to address with the steps above, you can clone the files into a directory in your web root and just get going. Sort of ... you still have to create a table in the AWS console (going to add the createTable wrapper shortly).</p> 
      <p><small>^</small> The "aws" folder contains a series of JARs. These JARs can be dropped directly into your {tomcat root}/lib or {Adobe ColdFusion 9 Install Folder}/wwwroot/WEB-INF/lib/ folder with no updates to the catalina.properties file.</p>
      <p>However, I prefer to keep my added JARs organized into their own folders for easier updates, etc. Hence, the use of the "aws" folder to hold all of these JARs.</p>
